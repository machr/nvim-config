# My Neovim config

Ideally should work similar to VSCode for the following technologies
- Javascript / TypeScript
- Vue
- Astro
- React
- TailwindCSS
- SCSS
- Node
- PHP/Blade files

### Todo list

- [X] Figure out why .vue files are being read wrong, e.g closing brackets not being found in ESlint
- [ ] Add auto-pairing of brackets when writing HTML
- [ ] Create a `mappings.lua` file with comments explaining what keybindings do because my memory is terrible
